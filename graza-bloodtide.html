            <div class="tier-label">What anyone in the Broken Isles would know</div>
            
            <p><strong>Graza Bloodtide</strong> is the Pirate Queen—the official ruler of the Broken Isles for the past three years. She commands the largest official fleet, collects tribute, enforces Harbor Peace, and represents the Isles in external matters.</p>
            
            <p>She's a half-orc woman who clawed her way from nothing to the throne through cunning, combat, and careful alliance-building. Everyone respects her. Everyone fears her. And everyone knows The Storm tolerates her—which is the real reason she rules.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Common saying:</strong> "The Queen sits the throne. The Storm lets her."

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>📖 Common Knowledge</h2>
            <div class="tier-label">What pirates, merchants, or Isles visitors would know</div>
            
            <h3>Appearance & Manner</h3>
            <p>Tall (6'2"), powerfully built. Green-gray skin, prominent tusks filed to sharp points. Black hair in dozens of small braids, each ending in a gold bead (one for every ship taken). Facial scars from countless battles. Dresses practically—leather armor, heavy boots—but with expensive touches: gold rings, silk sashes, a crown made from the teeth of her enemies.</p>
            
            <p>Commands rooms without raising her voice. Laughs easily, but the humor never quite reaches her eyes when politics are involved. Fights personally when challenged—has never lost.</p>
            
            <h3>Rise to Power</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Born in the Isles to an orc mother and unknown human father</li>
                <li>Served on ships from age 12</li>
                <li>Captain by 25 (took her ship in a mutiny)</li>
                <li>Built fleet through combat, alliance, and marriage (to a captain she later divorced)</li>
                <li>Claimed throne 3 years ago after previous monarch died in a storm</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Powers as Monarch</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Commands largest official fleet (not counting The Storm's)</li>
                <li>Collects tribute from all captains and settlements</li>
                <li>Enforces Harbor Peace (violence in Freehold = death)</li>
                <li>Represents the Isles to outsiders</li>
                <li>Settles major disputes between captains</li>
                <li>Coordinates defense against external threats</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Flagship: <em>Crimson Dawn</em></h3>
            <p>Fast, heavily armed, painted blood-red. Crew of 120, all hand-picked veterans. The most feared ship in the Isles—except for <em>Sorrow</em>.</p>

            <h3>The Storm's Shadow</h3>
            <p>Graza knows the truth: she rules because Vaelith lets her. If she ever truly challenged him, she'd lose.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Her calculation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Storm doesn't want to rule (too much politics)</li>
                <li>He needs someone to handle daily governance</li>
                <li>She's competent and doesn't threaten him</li>
                <li>As long as she doesn't cross him, she's useful</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What haunts her:</strong> Is she really a queen, or just his puppet? Does anyone respect her, or just fear The Storm through her?</p>
            
            <h3>Her Long Game</h3>
            <p>Graza isn't content to be a figurehead forever. Her strategy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Build legitimacy:</strong> Make decisions that benefit everyone (done)</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen fleet:</strong> Commission ships from Skarath (in progress)</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivate allies:</strong> Captains loyal to HER, not tradition (ongoing)</li>
                <li><strong>Wait:</strong> The Storm is mortal. Eventually he'll die. (Theoretically.)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>The fear:</strong> What if he never dies? Drow live centuries. She has decades at most.</p>
            
            <h3>Her Actual Beliefs</h3>
            <p>Despite the politics, Graza genuinely believes in the Isles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Isles gave her a chance when the mainland would have killed her</li>
                <li>Freedom through strength is real—she's living proof</li>
                <li>The confederation works; she wants to make it stronger</li>
                <li>Harbor Peace is sacred—she'd kill family to protect it</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Her Vulnerability</h3>
            <p>She has a daughter, age 8, kept hidden in Saltmere. The girl's father was a brief affair with a human merchant—one of the few times Graza let her guard down. Only three people know: Graza, the girl's caretakers, and The Storm (who knows everything).</p>
            
            <p><strong>What she fears:</strong> Someone using her daughter against her. She's considered bringing the girl to Freehold, but that would make her a target.</p>

        <div class="plot-hooks">
            <h3>🎲 Story Hooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Queen's Mission:</strong> Graza needs something done that can't be traced to her. Deniable operatives welcome.</li>
                <li><strong>The Daughter:</strong> Someone's asking questions in Saltmere. The Queen needs the problem handled quietly.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> A captain formally challenges for the throne. Graza must fight or lose everything.</li>
                <li><strong>The Storm Speaks:</strong> Vaelith actually gives her an order. What could make him care enough to act?</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimacy Crisis:</strong> Evidence surfaces that her claim to the throne was manipulated. Even if it's not true, the rumor could destroy her.</li>
