                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Vaelith Draegor, known as <strong>The Storm</strong> or <strong>The Sea Lord</strong>, is the most powerful pirate in the Broken Isles—and the one who created the confederation itself. A 300-year-old drow who escaped the Empire's genocide of his people, he commands a fleet of 40+ ships and sails aboard <em>Sorrow</em>, an ancient sentient vessel with which he shares a psychic bond.</p>
                
                <p>118 years ago, when the Elven Empire sent a fleet to purge the islands of escaped drow, Vaelith united every captain and crushed them at the Battle of the Broken Straits. The grateful pirates begged him to be their king. He refused—but the confederation he created that day still operates in his shadow.</p>
                
                <blockquote>He could rule the Broken Isles whenever he wishes. He doesn't want to.</blockquote>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hair:</strong> White, long, often loose and salt-crusted from the sea wind</li>
                    <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Pale gray—centuries of salt and sun have faded typical drow obsidian to something ghostly</li>
                    <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Washed-out violet, almost white—like the color bled out over centuries</li>
                    <li><strong>Build:</strong> Lean and wiry, deceptively strong, moves with unsettling stillness</li>
                    <li><strong>Presence:</strong> He stands like the sea before a hurricane—calm, patient, inevitable</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>He doesn't look like a drow anymore. He looks like what the sea made from one.</em></p>

                <h2>Personality: The Quiet Storm</h2>
                
                <h3>Demeanor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speaks softly, rarely more than necessary</li>
                    <li>Long silences don't bother him—spent years with only <em>Sorrow</em> for company</li>
                    <li>Watches everything, reacts to little</li>
                    <li>When he does speak, the weight of it stops conversations</li>
                    <li>Smiles rarely; when he does, it doesn't reach his eyes</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Violence</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No warning. No threats. No posturing.</li>
                    <li>One moment still; the next, blood</li>
                    <li>Against most enemies: efficient, clean, professional</li>
                    <li>Against the Empire: prolonged, thorough, hateful</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What He Cares About</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong><em>Sorrow</em></strong> — his ship, his partner, his only love</li>
                    <li><strong>The Broken Isles</strong> — home, worth protecting</li>
                    <li><strong>Destroying Empire vessels</strong> — the only thing resembling purpose</li>
                </ol>

            <section>
                <h2>The Ship: <em>Sorrow</em></h2>
                
                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>Ancient beyond knowing. <em>Sorrow</em> was already old when Vaelith found it trapped in an underground bay—a ship built by hands long forgotten, for purposes no one remembers. It had waited there in the dark, alone, for centuries. Maybe longer.</p>
                <p>Then a broken drow boy washed through the tunnels, half-drowned, having lost everything. They found each other.</p>
                
                <h3>The Bond</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Psychic connection—no words needed, just knowing</li>
                    <li><em>Sorrow</em> feels Vaelith's emotions; he feels its... hungers</li>
                    <li>300 years together, never apart for more than hours</li>
                    <li>The ship is not a tool. It's his partner. His only companion.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Capabilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faster than any ship has a right to be</li>
                    <li>Can sense vessels before they appear on the horizon</li>
                    <li>Repairs itself slowly (splinters reknit, ropes reweave)</li>
                    <li>Some say it influences the wind around it</li>
                    <li>Vaelith always knows where it is, and it always knows where he is</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>The Bloodline Oath</h3>
                    <p>Sixty years ago, a captain named Rorik Thenn got drunk in Freehold Harbor and rammed <em>Sorrow</em> while trying to leave harbor. Damaged the hull. An accident.</p>
                    <p>Vaelith killed Rorik that night. Then his first mate (Rorik's brother). Then sailed to the mainland and spent three months hunting down Rorik's father, his two sisters, his uncle, and his uncle's children.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Thenn family no longer exists.</strong></p>
                    <p>No one has touched <em>Sorrow</em> since.</p>

                <h2>Backstory: The Massacre of Vel'thara</h2>
                
                <h3>300 Years Ago</h3>
                <p>Vel'thara was a drow city hidden in deep caverns beneath the mountains. Not large, perhaps three thousand souls, but it was home. They had survived for generations by staying hidden, staying quiet.</p>
                <p>The <a href="elven-empire.html">Elven Empire</a> found them anyway.</p>
                
                <h3>What Vaelith Lost</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ilaena</strong> — his mother, a weaver, killed defending the children's quarter</li>
                    <li><strong>Nhilaya</strong> — his younger sister, fourteen years old, never found</li>
                    <li>His entire community—every face he'd known since birth</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Escape</h3>
                <p>When the soldiers reached his quarter, Vaelith ran. He found an underground river and jumped, preferring drowning to Imperial blades. The river took him, smashed him through tunnels, and deposited him in a cavern bay lit by phosphorescent moss.</p>
                <p>And there, resting in the shallows like it had been waiting... was a ship.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>No surrender accepted</li>

                    <li>Cargo burned with the ship</li>

                    <li>Professional, not cruel</li>

                <h3>Why He Doesn't Rule</h3>
                <blockquote>"I don't want your throne. I want the sea. Choose your own king. Make your own laws. I will be here if the Empire returns. That is enough."</blockquote>
                <p>Vaelith created the confederation but refused to lead it. He doesn't want power, doesn't want responsibility, doesn't want to govern squabbling pirates. He wants to sail, and he wants to kill Empire ships. Everything else is noise.</p>
                
                <h3>What He Actually Does</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attends The Moot maybe once a year (if something matters)</li>
                    <li>Enforces Harbor Peace by reputation alone</li>
                    <li>Hunts Empire shipping year-round</li>
                    <li>Occasionally appears to "suggest" changes to policy</li>
                    <li>His suggestions are always followed</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Shadow Monarch</h3>
                <p>Every Pirate King or Queen knows the truth: they rule because Vaelith allows it. If he ever decided to take the throne, no one could stop him. His indifference to power is what makes the current system work.</p>
                <p><a href="graza-bloodtide.html">Queen Graza</a> understands this perfectly. She rules the Isles. He rules the sea. Neither interferes with the other.</p>

                <h3>With <a href="graza-bloodtide.html">Queen Graza</a></h3>
                <p>Mutual respect. He nodded at her coronation—in the Broken Isles, that's an endorsement. She doesn't bother him with politics; he doesn't undermine her authority. It works.</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>With the Empire</h3>
                <p>500,000 gold bounty on his head. Never claimed. Never will be. The hunters become the hunted when they enter his waters.</p>
                
                <h3>With <a href="veraheim.html">Veraheim</a></h3>
                <p>Has never approached Veraheim waters. Whether he fears <a href="thorongil.html">Thorongil</a> or simply doesn't care about the sanctuary city is unknown. The dragon and The Storm have never met.</p>
