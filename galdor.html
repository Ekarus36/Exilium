            <h2>The Regrets He Carries</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>1. The Dragon War (400 Years Ago)</h3>
                <p><strong>What Haunts Him:</strong> Fought dragons for 35 days. Saw most dragon-elf bonds break or end in death. Beat dragons into retreat without killing them. Survived when others didn't.</p>
                <p><strong>The Guilt:</strong> Why him? Why his dragon? Survivor's guilt for 400 years. 320 years as last dragon rider before meeting Vera.</p>

                <p><strong>The Orders:</strong> Elven Empire sent him to eliminate Vera. He went intending to kill her. Didn't question the orders.</p>
                <p><strong>What He Regrets:</strong> His automatic obedience, his prejudice, his narrow-mindedness. Almost killed the love of his life. "I was prepared to murder an innocent. What does that make me?"</p>
                
                <h3>3. What He Lost vs What He Gained</h3>
                <p><strong>Lost:</strong> His people, his position, his culture, his homeland<br>
                <strong>Gained:</strong> Vera, purpose, freedom, home, peace<br>
                <strong>The Balance:</strong> Worth it? Yes. But he still mourns what he lost.</p>
