            <div class="tier-label">What anyone in Exilium would know</div>
            
            <p>Magic exists in Exilium, but how it's treated depends entirely on <strong>where you are</strong> and <strong>what type</strong> you practice.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sorcerers</strong> (born with magic) are the most controversial—celebrated in the Empire, hunted in the Kingdom, welcomed in Veraheim.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Wizards</strong> (learned magic) are accepted everywhere but restricted by class in the Kingdom.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Divine casters</strong> (clerics, paladins) are universally accepted—they serve the gods.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Warlocks don't exist yet.</strong> The Great Storm blocks extraplanar contact.</p>

            <h2>📖 Magic Types & Social Status</h2>
            
            <h3>🔥 Sorcerers - "Naturals"</h3>
            <p>Born with innate magical ability. Approximately 1 in 1,000 births across all races.</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr><th>Region</th><th>Treatment</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Elven Empire</strong></td><td class="text-green">Celebrated</td><td>Trained as "Naturals," given status</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Human Kingdom</strong></td><td class="text-red">Hunted</td><td>Innate magic = dangerous = executed</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Veraheim</strong></td><td class="text-green">Welcomed</td><td>Judged by contribution, not origin</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Broken Isles</strong></td><td class="text-blue">Valued</td><td>Power is power—no prejudice</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Kingdom Policy:</strong> Sorcerers are considered unnatural threats. If discovered, they're executed or forced to flee. Vera Wyrdweaver herself escaped this fate 100 years ago.
            </div>
            
            <h3>📚 Wizards - Learned Magic</h3>
            <p>Magic acquired through study and training. Requires education and resources.</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr><th>Region</th><th>Treatment</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Elven Empire</strong></td><td class="text-green">Universal access</td><td>All elves can study if they wish</td></tr>

            </table>
            
            <h3>⚔️ Skill Magic (Bards, Rangers)</h3>
            <p>Magic expressed through talent and practice—music, nature connection.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Status:</strong> Generally accepted everywhere. Seen as "talent" rather than dangerous power. Bards are especially welcome for entertainment and news. Rangers valued for wilderness expertise.</p>
            
            <h3>🙏 Divine Magic (Clerics, Paladins)</h3>
            <p>Power granted by the gods through faith and devotion.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Status:</strong> Universally accepted. Every culture has religious traditions. Divine casters serve their communities. Even the Kingdom, which fears sorcerers, venerates holy warriors.</p>
            
            <h3>🌿 Druids - Nature's Servants</h3>
            <p>Magic drawn from the natural world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Status:</strong> Live in isolated circles away from cities. Avoid public magic use. Not persecuted but not integrated. Most people rarely encounter druids. When they do, they're treated with respect and wariness.</p>
            
            <h3>⛔ Warlocks - The Missing Class</h3>
            <p><strong>Warlocks don't exist in Exilium.</strong></p>
            
            <p>The Great Storm—a permanent magical phenomenon surrounding the world—blocks contact with extraplanar entities. No one can form pacts with otherworldly patrons because no one can reach them.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>DM Note:</strong> If you want warlocks in your campaign, the Great Storm could be weakening, or certain locations might be exceptions. This is a deliberate design choice to make warlocks special when they appear.

            <h2>🔍 Detection</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Detecting sorcerous ability before manifestation is nearly impossible. A child might be 15 before their power emerges. By then, they've lived their whole life in a community.</p>
            
            <h3>Thorongil's Gift</h3>
            <p>The dragon Thorongil can sense sorcerous manifestation within approximately 5 miles. He's detected several young sorcerers in Veraheim's territory and quietly arranged their protection.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This is unique.</strong> No other reliable detection method exists. The Kingdom relies on informants and observation of unusual events.</p>
            
            <h3>Signs of Manifestation</h3>
            <p>How sorcerous power typically reveals itself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emotional outbursts causing magical effects</li>
                <li>Objects moving or changing without explanation</li>
                <li>Strange dreams that affect reality</li>
                <li>Unusual resistance to harm</li>
                <li>Accidental fire, ice, or lightning during stress</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Great Storm's Nature</h3>
            <p>The Great Storm isn't natural. Something created it. The oldest dragons remember a time before it existed—when extraplanar contact was possible, when entities from beyond could walk the world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What ended that era?</strong> No one knows. The Storm appeared, and the boundaries sealed. Some scholars believe it was divine intervention. Others think it was a magical catastrophe. A few suggest it was deliberate—protection against something worse.</p>
            
            <h3>The Storm Is Weakening</h3>
            <p>In the past few decades, isolated incidents suggest the Great Storm may be failing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dreams featuring entities that shouldn't exist</li>
                <li>Whispers at the edges of magic</li>
                <li>A few individuals showing powers that don't fit any category</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>If the Storm fails entirely:</strong> Extraplanar entities could enter the world. Warlocks could form. Ancient evils might return. The entire magical order could collapse.</p>
            
            <h3>Vera's True Power</h3>
            <p>Vera Wyrdweaver is the most powerful sorcerer alive—but even she doesn't fully understand her limits. Her magic has no clear ceiling. She's split mountains. She could potentially do more.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What she fears:</strong> That she might be proof the Storm is weakening. That her power comes from somewhere else. That something is watching through her.</p>

            <h3>🎲 Story Hooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Hidden Sorcerer:</strong> A child in the Kingdom manifests. Their family contacts Veraheim. Can the PCs smuggle them out?</li>
                <li><strong>Storm Breach:</strong> Something speaks to a PC in dreams. Something from beyond the Storm. What does it want?</li>
                <li><strong>The First Warlock:</strong> Someone claims to have formed a pact. Impossible—but their power is real. What happened?</li>
                <li><strong>Vera's Question:</strong> The Lady of Veraheim asks the PCs to investigate strange magical phenomena. She's afraid of what they might find.</li>
                <li><strong>The Detection Problem:</strong> The Kingdom develops a new method to detect sorcerers. Veraheim suddenly has many more refugees—and spies.</li>
