            <p>400 years ago, for 35 terrible days, dragons attacked the Elven Empire.</p>
            
            <p>The official history says: <strong>The drow captured and tortured dragons, trying to force magical bonds like those elves shared. The dragons discovered this, blamed all elves, and attacked. The Empire barely survived. When the truth was discovered—that drow committed this atrocity—Emperor Valandor decreed their extermination.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Nearly all dragon-elf bonds were broken. Most Dragon Knights died with their partners. The dragons retreated to the northwestern mountains and haven't been seen since.</p>
            
            <p>Only one bonded pair survived intact: <strong>Thaelen Ruincalen and Thorongil</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>The Genocide Policy:</strong> For 400 years, drow have been killed on sight throughout the Empire. No trial. No mercy. No exceptions.

            <h3>The Dragon-Elf Bonds</h3>
            <p>Before the war, dragons and elves shared a unique relationship:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Telepathic bonds formed voluntarily</li>
                <li>Dragons chose their riders</li>
                <li>48 Dragon Knights served the Empire</li>
                <li>The bonds represented trust between species</li>
                <li>They'd existed for centuries</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Official Timeline</h3>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Day</th><th>Event</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Day 1</td><td>Dragons attack without warning. Three enclaves burn.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Days 2-10</td><td>Empire reels. Dragon Knights torn between species.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Days 11-20</td><td>Most bonds break. Knights die or lose their dragons.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Days 21-30</td><td>Desperate defense. Empire nearly falls.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Days 31-35</td><td>Dragons retreat suddenly. No explanation.</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>47 Dragon Knights</strong> died or lost their bonds</li>
                <li><strong>Only Thaelen and Thorongil</strong> remained intact</li>
                <li><strong>Dragons</strong> retreated to northwestern mountains</li>
                <li><strong>Investigation</strong> revealed drow torture chambers</li>
                <li><strong>Valandor's Decree</strong>: Drow genocide begins</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Thaelen Survived</h3>
            <p>Thaelen and Thorongil were on a mission when the war started. By the time they returned, the worst was over. Their bond held because they never had to fight each other's kin.</p>
            
            <p>Thorongil chose his rider over his species. He's considered a traitor by dragonkind.</p>

            <h2>🔒 Secret Knowledge</h2>
            <div class="tier-label">DM-only information</div>
            
            <div class="secret-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Contains major spoilers</h4>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Hidden Truth</h3>
            <p>The official history is a lie. The real story:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The war began over territory</strong>, not dragon torture</li>
                <li><strong>Elves struck first</strong> against drow settlements encroaching on dragon lands</li>
                <li><strong>Both sides committed atrocities</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The dragon torture was real</strong>—but it was <em>retaliation</em>, not the cause</li>
                <li><strong>The genocide was Valandor's rage</strong>, not justice</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Who Knows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emperor Valandor:</strong> Knows everything. Made the decision to bury it.</li>
                <li><strong>Velindor Shadowmere:</strong> Master of Whispers. Has killed to keep this secret.</li>
                <li><strong>The Living Archive:</strong> Contains sealed records. Thaelorin guards them.</li>
                <li><strong>Thaelen Ruincalen:</strong> Discovered the truth. It's why he defected.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What the Drow Did</h3>
            <p>After elven attacks on their settlements, drow scholars developed a theory: if they could force dragon bonds like elves had, they could defend themselves.</p>
            
            <p>They captured three young dragons. They tortured them trying to create artificial bonds. It didn't work. The dragons died. But not before one escaped and told the others what had been done.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The dragons didn't distinguish between elf and drow.</strong> To them, the subterranean cousins looked identical. They attacked everyone.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Valandor Lied</h3>
            <p>The truth would destroy the Empire's moral foundation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Elves started the conflict (territorial aggression)</li>
                <li>Drow responded to elven attacks (not unprovoked evil)</li>
                <li>400 years of genocide were based on a lie</li>
                <li>Valandor knew and ordered it anyway</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If this became public, the Empire would tear itself apart.</p>
            
            <h3>Thaelen's Discovery</h3>
            <p>80 years ago, Thaelen found evidence in the Living Archive. He confronted Velindor. Velindor confirmed it.</p>
            
            <p>Thaelen was ordered to forget what he learned. Instead, he defected—taking the last dragon with him.</p>
            
            <p><strong>His choice:</strong> Stay and serve an empire built on genocide and lies, or leave with Vera and build something honest.</p>
