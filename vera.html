            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <h3>Core Character: Pragmatic Realist with Tempered Idealism</h3>
            <p><strong>80 Years Ago:</strong> Young idealist who believed love and power could change the world<br>
            <strong>Now:</strong> Experienced leader who knows idealism has limits, but refuses to abandon it entirely</p>

            <h4>Key Traits:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> Makes hard choices because someone has to</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Aware:</strong> Constantly questions herself to avoid corruption</li>
                <li><strong>Decisive:</strong> 80 years of leadership means decisions come as second nature</li>
                <li><strong>Burdened:</strong> Carries the weight of those she cannot save</li>
                <li><strong>Principled:</strong> Won't compromise core values despite pragmatism</li>

            <h2>Magical Power</h2>
            <h3>Unmatched Sorcerer</h3>
            <p><strong>To Defeat Her Magically:</strong> Would require the top 10 trained wizards in the realm, working as a coordinated team. Even then, victory is not guaranteed.</p>

            <h4>Why She's Unmatched:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sorcerer, not wizard - magic is innate, part of her being</li>
                <li>100 years of practice = mastery through experience</li>
                <li>Instinctive casting - magic is second nature, no thought needed</li>
                <li>Reflexes honed - decisions and reactions happen automatically</li>
                <li>No decline - power hasn't weakened with age</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mountain-Splitting Power:</h4>
            <p>80 years ago, split a mountain range in rage/desperation. Could do it again if necessary, though it would require recovery time. That level of power is weapon of last resort.</p>

            <h4>Veraheim's Magic Infrastructure:</h4>
            <p><strong>All city magic runs on Vera's power:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Three Lifts:</strong> Animated objects under her command</li>
                <li>Can command them remotely from anywhere in city</li>
                <li>Can disable all three simultaneously if threatened</li>
                <li>If she's incapacitated, lifts stop (safety measure)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Daily Life</h2>
            <h4>Morning (Dawn to Mid-Morning):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wakes at dawn naturally (100 years of habit)</li>
                <li>Private breakfast with Galdor (quiet time together)</li>
                <li>Morning meditation/magic attunement (maintains city enchantments, 30 min)</li>
                <li>Brief review of overnight reports</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mid-Morning to Afternoon (Working Hours):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public audiences</strong> (twice weekly) - citizens petition for help, dispute resolution</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative work</strong> (daily) - budget approvals, policy decisions, resource allocation</li>
                <li><strong>City inspections</strong> (weekly) - walks through districts, checks infrastructure</li>
                <li>Meetings with craft guilds and merchant councils</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Evening (Personal Time):</h4>
            <ul>

            <h2>The Floating Docks - Her Moral Burden</h2>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Her View: "We Can't Save Everyone"</h4>
                <p><em>"Where do we draw the line? If we help the Floats, they'll grow. More will come. Do we expand to 4,000? 5,000? 10,000? At what point does Veraheim collapse trying to save everyone?"</em></p>

                <h4>Her Logic:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Veraheim can support 3,500 people sustainably</li>
                    <li>Expanding means lower quality of life for current residents</li>
                    <li>Resources are finite (food, housing, guards, magic)</li>
                    <li>The Floats are overflow valve preventing worse alternatives</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Her Guilt:</h4>
                <p>Sees the Floats from her castle every single day. Knows children are drowning, people starving. This eats at her, but she won't change course.</p>

                <h4>The Halfling Girl Story:</h4>
                <p>Five years ago, an 8-year-old halfling girl from the Floats approached her: "Lady Vera, why can't my family live here? We'd work hard."</p>
                <p>The girl explained they spent everything on medicine for her baby brother.</p>
                <p>Vera gave the family gold anonymously (enough for two months), but didn't change the policy.</p>
                <p><strong>This haunts her more than anything.</strong> She knows she drew an arbitrary line. She knows she's a hypocrite. She never told anyone except Thorongil.</p>

            <h2>Relationship with Thorongil</h2>
            <h3>The Dragon She Learned to Love</h3>
            <p><strong>The Beginning (80 years ago):</strong> Thorongil was wary, protective of Galdor. She was the human intruder into their sacred dragon-elf bond.</p>

            <h4>The Slow Build:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>First decade: Tolerated her for Galdor's sake</li>
                <li>Second decade: Respect grew as he saw her character</li>
                <li>Third decade: True affection developed</li>
                <li>After 30 years: Thorongil opened telepathic link to her</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Now (After 80 Years):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>She rides him (privilege that took 30 years to earn)</li>
                <li>They have philosophical discussions (evening counsels)</li>
                <li>He is her moral compass and confessor</li>
                <li>She trusts him completely</li>
                <li>Strategic patrols, emergency flights, personal flights for clarity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Her Voice & Manner</h2>
            <h4>Voice/Tone - Warm but Firm:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Default:</strong> Warm, approachable, genuinely kind</li>
                <li><strong>When needed:</strong> Firm, commanding, brooks no argument</li>
                <li>Speaks clearly and directly (no flowery language)</li>
                <li>Listens more than she speaks</li>
                <li>Remembers names and details</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Triggers for Anger (rare but intense):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Substantial threats to Veraheim</strong> - Eyes glow green, voice goes deadly quiet</li>
                <li><strong>Accusations of corruption</strong> - Takes personally, defends fiercely</li>
                <li><strong>Harm to Galdor or Thorongil</strong> - Loses all restraint, most dangerous</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Her Greatest Fears</h2>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Losing Galdor</strong> - 80 years with him, couldn't bear to continue alone</li>
                    <li><strong>Becoming a tyrant</strong> - The power is there, one bad day could break her restraint</li>
                    <li><strong>Veraheim failing</strong> - Everything she built crumbling, proving cynics right</li>
                    <li><strong>Being right about the Floats</strong> - What if the pragmatism is correct? That's almost worse</li>
                </ol>
                <p>All four fears haunt her in different ways. The Galdor fear keeps her human. The tyrant fear keeps her moral. The Veraheim fear keeps her working. The Floats fear keeps her awake at night.</p>
