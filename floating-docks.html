            <div class="tier-label">What anyone approaching Veraheim would know</div>
            
            <p>Anchored in the harbor below Veraheim floats a collection of lashed-together boats, rafts, and derelict vessels—home to those who couldn't make it into the sanctuary above.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Floating Docks</strong> represent the price of Veraheim's idealism. The contribution system works because failures are expelled. The expelled have nowhere to go. So they stay, floating in the shadow of the city that rejected them.</p>
            
            <p>No law. No protection. Three gangs fight for territory. Children learn to swim before they walk. People drown in storms. Vera watches from her castle every single day.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Veraheim's rule:</strong> Those who cannot contribute must leave by sunset. The Docks are where they go.

            <div class="tier-label">What visitors, traders, or Docks residents would know</div>
            
            <h3>Who Lives Here</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Failed Veraheim applicants (couldn't prove contribution)</li>
                <li>Expelled citizens (lost ability to contribute)</li>
                <li>Refugees who never tried to enter Veraheim</li>
                <li>Criminals avoiding both empires</li>
                <li>Children born on the Docks (never knew anything else)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Physical Structure</h3>
            <p>Boats lashed together with rope and chain. Platforms built on barrels. Walkways that shift with waves. Lean-tos and tents. Everything rots. Everything sinks eventually.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sections:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Core:</strong> Oldest, most stable platforms. Gang territories.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ring:</strong> Newer additions around the edges. Less stable.</li>
                <li><strong>The Fringes:</strong> Single boats, isolated families. Dangerous.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Three Gangs</h3>
            <table>

                <tr><td><strong>Tide Reapers</strong></td><td>Roderick "The Eel"</td><td>Eastern Core</td><td>Smuggling, theft</td></tr>

            </table>
            
            <h3>Economy</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary income:</strong> Selling goods and services to Veraheim that residents don't want to do themselves—dangerous work, illegal work, dirty work.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Diving for salvage</li>
                <li>Fishing in dangerous waters</li>
                <li>Black market goods</li>
                <li>Information selling</li>
                <li>Services Veraheim won't acknowledge</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mama Kresh's Haven</h3>
            <p>The only kindness on the Docks. Run by an elderly orc woman, the Haven feeds hungry children and provides basic medical care. No one knows where her money comes from. No gang touches her. Some say Vera herself funds it secretly.</p>

            <h2>🔒 Secret Knowledge</h2>
            <div class="tier-label">DM-only information</div>
            
            <div class="secret-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Contains spoilers for players</h4>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Vera's Secret Support</h3>
            <p>Vera anonymously funds three things on the Docks:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mama Kresh's Haven:</strong> Monthly gold through intermediaries</li>
                <li><strong>The Water Barge:</strong> Subsidized to never run out</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Medicine:</strong> A healer who "volunteers"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>She's never told anyone except Thorongil. She doesn't change policy. She just... makes it slightly less terrible. She hates that this is all she does. She does it anyway.</p>
            
            <h3>The Halfling Girl</h3>
            <p>Five years ago, an 8-year-old halfling girl asked Vera why her family couldn't live in the city. They'd been expelled when her father got sick and couldn't work.</p>
            
            <p>Vera explained the contribution system. The girl said her baby brother got sick. They spent everything on medicine. Now they had nothing.</p>
            
            <p>Vera gave them gold—enough for two months. Anonymously. Then went back to her castle and cried. She told only Thorongil.</p>
            
            <p><strong>She didn't change the policy.</strong></p>
            
            <p>This haunts her more than anything else she's done.</p>
            
            <h3>The Docks' True Purpose</h3>
            <p>The Docks serve a function Veraheim doesn't acknowledge: they're a warning.</p>
            
            <p>Every citizen who thinks about slacking, about coasting, about not contributing—they look down and see the Docks. They see what happens to those who fail. The fear keeps them working.</p>
            
            <p>Vera knows this. She uses it. She hates that she uses it.</p>
            
            <h3>Rising Tension</h3>
            <p>The Docks population has grown in recent years. More refugees from Kingdom persecution. More failed applicants as Veraheim's standards rise.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Someone is organizing.</strong> Quietly. Carefully. They're not planning violence—yet. They're planning to present a united front. Demand recognition. Demand change.</p>
            
            <p>When that day comes, Vera will have to choose: expand Veraheim beyond its capacity, or refuse people she's already watching suffer.</p>

            <h3>🎲 Story Hooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Organizer:</strong> Someone on the Docks is building a movement. Who are they? What do they want? Can they be reasoned with—or stopped?</li>
                <li><strong>Mama Kresh's Secret:</strong> The old orc is dying. Someone needs to continue her work—but first they need to find where her funding comes from.</li>
                <li><strong>The Halfling Family:</strong> That family from five years ago. What happened to them? Vera wants to know but can't ask directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Gang War:</strong> The three gangs are about to clash. The Docks could become a bloodbath. Someone needs to intervene.</li>
                <li><strong>The Drowning Season:</strong> Storms are coming. The Docks will lose people. Can anything be done?</li>
