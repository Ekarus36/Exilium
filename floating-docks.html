                <strong>Location:</strong> Anchored in open water off Veraheim's harbor<br>
                <strong>Status:</strong> Lawless, no official recognition<br>

            <h2>Overview - The Cruel Truth</h2>
            <p>The Floating Docks are the grim reality that exists in the shadow of Veraheim's idealistic sanctuary. Where Veraheim represents hope through contribution and merit, the Floats represent what happens to those who cannot meet that standard—or cannot afford to try.</p>

            <blockquote>"You can visit Veraheim during daylight hours, but if you cannot afford housing or prove your contribution, you must leave by sunset. The Floating Docks is where they go."</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Rule: "Off by Sunset"</h2>
            
            <h3>Who Lives Here</h3>

            <h4>The Desperate:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>People who come to Veraheim but cannot afford entry</li>
                <li>Visitors not allowed to stay after sunset (non-contributors)</li>
                <li>Day laborers who earn enough to survive but not enough for city housing</li>
                <li>Refugees too poor to qualify for citizenship</li>
                <li>Those who failed the evaluation period</li>
                <li>Families saving money to afford city entry</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Unwanted:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Criminals fleeing justice from Empire or Kingdom (no extradition here)</li>
                <li>Outcasts even Veraheim won't accept</li>
                <li>Black market traders avoiding city oversight</li>
                <li>Those expelled from Veraheim for minor infractions</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Hopeful:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Young people trying to prove themselves worthy</li>
                <li>Craftsmen building reputation to win shop challenges</li>
                <li>Anyone still dreaming of earning a place above</li>

            <h2>Structure of the Floats</h2>
            <p>Each "float" is an independent artificial island made of boats, barges, rafts, and debris lashed together with rope, chain, and desperation. They drift in a loose cluster, anchored in open water just beyond Veraheim's jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>Notable Establishments</h3>

            <h2>The Three Gangs</h2>
            <p>Three criminal organizations prey on Float residents, each controlling different territories and rackets.</p>

            <h2>Veraheim's Position</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>Why Vera and Galdor Don't Intervene</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Jurisdiction:</h4>
                <p>The Floats are in international waters, technically outside Veraheim's authority. Any military action would be seen as aggression by both major powers.</p>

                <h4>2. Resource Limits:</h4>
                <p>Veraheim has 300 guards for 3,500 residents. Cannot spare forces to police the Floats.</p>

                <h4>3. No Solution:</h4>
                <p>Break up the gangs, more would form. Bring everyone into city, population becomes unsustainable. Build housing on Floats, it becomes Veraheim-2 (same problems).</p>

                <h4>4. Overflow Valve:</h4>
                <p>The Floats prevent worse alternatives. Without it, desperate people would storm Veraheim, camp outside walls, create bigger crisis.</p>

                <h4>5. The Guilt:</h4>
                <p>Vera sees the Floats from her castle every day. Knows children are drowning. This eats at her. But she won't change course.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What Veraheim Does Do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows day work passes (Float residents can work in city during daylight)</li>
                <li>Water barge delivers clean water daily (subsidized by Veraheim)</li>
                <li>Guards protect anyone who reaches the lifts (once you touch them, you're safe)</li>
                <li>Vera secretly funds Mama Kresh's Haven</li>
                <li>Veraheim will help anyone who earns citizenship (path exists, just difficult)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Moral Question</h2>
            <blockquote>"Where do we draw the line? If we help the Floats, they'll grow. More will come. Do we expand to 4,000? 5,000? 10,000? At what point does Veraheim collapse trying to save everyone?"<br><br>- Vera Wyrdweaver</blockquote>

            <p>The Floating Docks represent the fundamental tension at the heart of Exilium:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can idealism survive reality?</li>
                <li>Is merit-based citizenship just? Or cruel?</li>
                <li>Who decides who deserves saving?</li>
                <li>Is Vera right to draw the line at 3,500?</li>
                <li>Or is she a hypocrite who could do more?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>There are no easy answers.</strong></p>
