                <h2>Era of the First Peoples</h2>
                <p>When the first mainlanders arrived, the islands were already inhabited. Orc clans controlled <a href="stormcrag.html">Stormcrag</a>, goblin tribes claimed Greenfire Isle, and bugbear bands roamed <a href="mistwood.html">Mistwood</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Where did they come from?</strong> No one knows. Not even the orcs, goblins, or bugbears themselves. They simply are, and have been for longer than memory.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Era of the Refugees (~200-120 years ago)</h2>
                <p>As persecution intensified on the mainland, desperate people sought refuge anywhere they could find. The Broken Isles—distant, ungoverned, unknown to most—became a destination.</p>
                
                <h3>Who Came</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>From the Human Kingdom:</strong> Commoners, criminals, deserters, the desperate</li>
                    <li><strong>From the Elven Empire:</strong> Drow fleeing genocide, dissidents, those wanting freedom</li>
                    <li><strong>Others:</strong> Half-breeds rejected by both societies, adventurers, traders</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Integration wasn't peaceful. The First Peoples didn't welcome newcomers with open arms. Over decades, rough equilibrium emerged through trade and shared enemies.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Empire's Wrath (~118 years ago)</h2>
                <p>The <a href="elven-empire.html">Elven Empire</a> grew tired of drow refugees escaping to the Broken Isles. The genocide was meant to be complete—survivors were an insult to Imperial authority.</p>
                
                <h3>The Purge Fleet</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>40+ warships assembled</li>
                    <li>Thousands of soldiers</li>
                    <li>Battle mages</li>
                    <li>Orders to show no mercy</li>
                    <li><em>"Cleanse the islands of traitors and vermin"</em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When word reached the Broken Isles, panic spread. Individual captains couldn't fight a fleet. There was no unified command, no defensive plan. Many prepared to flee. Others prepared to die.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Storm Rises</h2>
                <p><a href="vaelith-draegor.html">Vaelith Draegor</a> had been sailing the Broken Isles for approximately 180 years at this point. He'd built his fleet to 30+ ships. He'd destroyed countless Empire vessels. But he'd never involved himself in Isles politics.</p>
                <p><strong>This was different.</strong> The Empire wasn't coming for pirates. They were coming for drow. For his people. For the survivors of genocides like the one that killed his family.</p>
                
                <blockquote>"The Empire comes to finish what they started. They will hunt every drow. Then every half-breed. Then everyone who ever helped us. There is no running far enough. There is no hiding deep enough. We fight, or we die—not today, but soon, one by one, until none remain."</blockquote>
                
                <p><strong>Every captain present chose to fight.</strong></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Battle of the Broken Straits</h2>
                <p>The Empire fleet entered the straits between the major islands, expecting scattered resistance. They found a united armada of approximately 100 vessels waiting.</p>
                
                <h3>The Result</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>30+ Imperial ships sunk or captured</li>
                    <li>Only a handful escaped to tell the tale</li>
                    <li>Thousands of Imperial soldiers dead</li>
                    <li>Fleet commander killed</li>
                    <li>The drow they came to hunt watched their hunters drown</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The Empire has never attempted another major expedition.</strong> The memory of that defeat still burns.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Founding</h2>
                <p>When the surviving captains gathered after the battle, they begged Vaelith to lead them:</p>
                <blockquote>"You saved us. You united us. Be our king."</blockquote>
                
                <p><strong>Vaelith refused:</strong></p>
                <blockquote>"I don't want your throne. I want the sea. Choose your own king. Make your own laws. I will be here if the Empire returns. That is enough."</blockquote>
                
                <h3>The First Moot</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Established the Moot as governing council</li>
                    <li>Created the position of Pirate King/Queen</li>
                    <li>Codified Harbor Peace (Vaelith's demand)</li>
                    <li>Made <a href="freehold-harbor.html">Freehold Harbor</a> the official capital</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Everyone understood:</strong> The monarch would rule day-to-day. The Moot would make decisions. But Vaelith was the real power. His refusal to rule didn't diminish his authority—it enhanced it.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What Vaelith Created</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A confederation that doesn't depend on him</strong> — It runs itself</li>
                    <li><strong>But could not exist without him</strong> — He is the foundation</li>
                    <li><strong>And cannot defy him</strong> — Everyone remembers who saved them</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>The Broken Isles are his. They just govern themselves.</em></p>
