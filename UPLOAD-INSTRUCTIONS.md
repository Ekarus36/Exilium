1. world-overview.html
2. vera.html

## 🚀 How to Upload to GitHub

### Step 1: Extract the Files
1. Download the .tar.gz file I gave you
2. Extract it (double-click on Mac/Windows, or use `tar -xzf filename.tar.gz` on Linux)
3. You'll get a folder with all the .html, .css, and .js files

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/exilium
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop ALL the files** from the extracted folder
4. Scroll down, add commit message: "Added 5 new content pages"
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Step 3: Wait & Test
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
2. Visit: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/exilium/
3. Test the new pages!

## 🔗 Your New Pages

Once uploaded, these URLs will work:
- https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/exilium/world-overview.html
- https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/exilium/vera.html
- https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/exilium/veraheim.html
- https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/exilium/galdor.html
- https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/exilium/thorongil.html

## ✅ What Works Now

After uploading, your wiki will have:
- ✅ Beautiful homepage
- ✅ Complete world lore overview
- ✅ All three founders (Vera, Galdor, Thorongil) fully detailed
- ✅ Veraheim city complete
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Dark fantasy theme

## 📝 Pages Still Needed (We can add later)

The sidebar navigation has links to these pages that don't exist yet:
- Geography, Magic Items, Religion
- Floating Docks, Elven Enclaves
- Timeline, Dragon War, The Founding
- Elven Empire, Human Kingdom, Drow Persecution
- Círdan Golvenion

**These will show as broken links** until we create them. That's okay! The core content is complete.

## 🎨 Optional: Hide Unfinished Links

If you want to hide the broken links temporarily, you can:
1. Edit index.html on GitHub
2. Remove or comment out the navigation links we haven't created yet

Or just leave them - players will see the core content works great!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Links not working?**
- Make sure filenames are exactly: `vera.html` (not `Vera.html`)
- Wait 3-5 minutes after uploading
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

**Styling looks broken?**
- Make sure `styles.css` uploaded correctly
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your wiki is live and functional with the most important content!
