                <h2>The Swarm Tactics</h2>
                <p>Nix's fleet operates unlike any other in the Isles:</p>
                
                <h3>The Ships</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>30+ small vessels (skiffs, cutters, converted fishing boats)</li>
                    <li>Each carries 10-20 goblins</li>
                    <li>Fast, maneuverable, expendable</li>
                    <li>Built or modified at <a href="skarath.html">Skarath</a> (family discount)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Swarm surrounds target</li>
                    <li>Multiple boarding attempts simultaneously</li>
                    <li>Overwhelm through numbers</li>
                    <li>If target flees, the swarm follows</li>
                    <li>If target fights, goblins pour aboard from every direction</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Why It Works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can't sink them all—too many targets</li>
                    <li>Can't flee—they're faster</li>
                    <li>Can't fight—outnumbered on your own deck</li>
                    <li>Loss of a few ships doesn't matter to the Swarm</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Family Connections</h2>
                <h3>The Skarath Advantage</h3>
                <p>Nix's great-aunt is Grand Tinkerboss Rizkit Brassclaw, ruler of <a href="skarath.html">Skarath</a>. This gives him:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discounted ship construction and repairs</li>
                    <li>Priority service at the Yards</li>
                    <li>Political connections in the shipbuilding capital</li>
                    <li>Information about other captains' ship orders</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote>"My great-aunt runs the Yards. You think I got thirty ships by accident? Family discount, friend. Family discount."</blockquote>

                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <h3>With <a href="graza-bloodtide.html">Queen Graza</a></h3>
                <p>Loyal supporter—Nix benefits from stable confederation and likes Graza personally. His swarm is valuable in any confederation defense.</p>
                
                <h3>With Other Captains</h3>
                <p>Annoying but useful. Nobody wants to be swarmed. Everyone appreciates having Nix on their side in a fight.</p>
                
                <h3>With <a href="kozrek-admiral.html">The Admiral</a></h3>
                <p>Mutual disdain. Kozrek's precise formations versus Nix's chaotic swarms. Oil and water. But effective when forced to cooperate.</p>

                <blockquote>"One ship? Who needs one ship? I have THIRTY!"</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"You can kill a goblin. You can't kill an idea. And my idea is MORE GOBLINS."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"The big ships have to worry about sinking. We're already so close to the water, what's a little swim?"</blockquote>
