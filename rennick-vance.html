                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Rennick Vance is unique among the legendary captains—he commands only a single ship, <em>The Last Dance</em>. His legendary status comes not from fleet size but from personal combat prowess. He is considered the deadliest duelist in the Broken Isles, possibly the entire known world, and has killed more captains in single combat than most pirates kill in their entire careers.</p>

                <h2>The Ship: <em>The Last Dance</em></h2>
                <p>A fast, sleek vessel built by <a href="skarath.html">Skarath's</a> finest Sketchmaster (Tizzi Three-Fingers). Designed for speed over firepower—Rennick doesn't need cannons when he can board and kill the enemy captain personally.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crew of ~40 (small but elite)</li>
                    <li>Fastest ship in the Isles (except possibly <em>Sorrow</em>)</li>
                    <li>Light armament—relies on speed and boarding</li>

                <h2>Why He's Legendary</h2>
                <p>Fleet size determines most captains' power. Rennick breaks this rule. One ship, forty crew—but everyone knows that challenging him means facing him in single combat. And facing Rennick in single combat means dying.</p>
                
                <h3>The Captain's Gambit</h3>
                <p>His standard tactic: approach a target, signal for the enemy captain to meet him in single combat. If the captain wins, Rennick's crew surrenders. If Rennick wins, the enemy ship surrenders.</p>
                <p><strong>No captain has ever won.</strong></p>

            <section>
                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <h3>With Other Captains</h3>
                <p>Everyone respects him. Everyone fears him. No one wants to be the one he challenges.</p>
                
                <h3>With <a href="vaelith-draegor.html">The Storm</a></h3>
                <p>The only person Rennick has never challenged. Whether this is wisdom, respect, or acknowledgment that The Storm fights differently is unknown.</p>

                <h2>Quotes</h2>
                <blockquote>"I don't need a fleet. I only need to be faster than you."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Every duel is a conversation. Most people don't speak the language."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"You have a choice: your ship, or your life. I'm being generous—most pirates wouldn't offer."</blockquote>
